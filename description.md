To keep pace with the modern world English is a must Language to learn . There can be various 
Sources and ways from which one can capture this language . Learning English through entertainment
is quite an impressive and fun way to get a strong grip on English . One of those form can be to watch
movies or tv series or documentries with English subtitles . Main focus  of this project is to familiarize the users with English 
vocabulary as much as possible efficiently , saving the search time on search engines.

Work-flows and Functionalities:
=========
1. Initially each and every user have to create a user account for the purpose filtering words.

2. Lets say person "A" wants to watch a movie “B” along with English subtitle . Now on a specific moment
of time lets say "A" wants to pause the video and look for some vocabulary searching on any search 
engine which is a pretty annoying task if more than 2 or 3 words are unknown for a user on that 
specific time of subtitle. With the help of this web application person "A" will just input the exact time-stamp into the webpage
rather than searching word by word depending on the search engine.
And that will provide information of that specific ** TimeStamps subtitle-words ** . The user 
will only have to input the time stamps and following that user will
Get every words information as an output on the web page according to the specific timestamp.

3. In order to make the web-app more user friendly users will have the freedom to select a specific word on a specific moment of timestamp eventually **filtering** the known words from the unknown words.Thus it will save a huge amount of time and user will have an enjoyable experience both watching videos as well as gaining vocabulary knowledge from desired videos with subtitles.
